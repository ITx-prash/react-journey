# ⚛️ **30 Days of React (Starting Phase)**

Welcome to my **30 Days of React** journey! This repository, `react-journey`, documents my progress as I dive into React.js with an initial 30 days challenge. I'll be building different projects, learning core concepts, and documenting everything I learn along the way.

_This README will be updated each day as I progress through the challenge._

🔗 **Live Demo:** [react-journy.vercel.app](https://react-journy.vercel.app/)

## 🚀 **Goal**

- To build a strong foundation in React.js.
- To create a variety of projects, ranging from simple components to more complex applications.
- To practice project-based learning by taking inspiration from various resources.
- To maintain consistency and accountability by sharing my progress daily.
